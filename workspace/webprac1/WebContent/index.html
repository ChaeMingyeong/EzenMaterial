	  It used to be the German Schneeballen. 
	  Then it was the Japanese roll cake, Hong Kong cookies 
	  and cupcakes from New York’s Magnolia Bakery. 
	  Now, it’s Taiwan’s turn.
      The best way to figure out the latest trends in the dessert 
      industry is to visit a department store’s food section. 
      Foreign desserts usually make their debut in Korea by opening a branch 
      in Korea’s major department stores, such as Hyundai, Lotte
      or Shinsegae. Magnolia, a famous U.S. cupcake brand, opened 
      its first store in Hyundai Department Store’s Pangyo branch
      in 2015.
      Among the dessert stores in the Food Street area of Hyundai 
      City Mall in southern Seoul, is Sobosobo, a Taiwanese butter
      streusel store. The butter streusel is different from 
      the typical streusel, which doesn’t have anything inside it, 
      in that it is filled with cream made out of butter 
      and red bean paste. Sobosobo opened pop-up stores in Hyundai 
      Department Store’s Apgujeong branch in southern Seoul, 
      and at Lotte Department Store’s main branch in central Seoul 
      earlier this year and quickly became popular.
